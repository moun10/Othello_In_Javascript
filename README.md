# Othello Javascript
This is a game played by two players on the linux terminal. It will ask player 1 to pick
board size and color. When he does, it uses a dynamic function to determine the correct board locations 
on a 2d array. Then will tell the user if their choice is possible or
or not possible. This game automatically executes game over if either player wins.

The code is written in Javascript and is meant to run on a
Linux based machine.

The [`main`](main.js) file will execute the game itself.

```python
def twitter_callback(tweet):
    companies = analysis.find_companies(tweet)
    if companies:
        trading.make_trades(companies)
        twitter.tweet(companies, tweet)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    twitter.start_streaming(twitter_callback)
```
